Fluxus One presents each user with a diverse set of features. Designed to be immediately intuitive, the pathway of learning allows a user to grow into the module.

-   **4 Channel, 64 Step Sequencer** 
    -   Sequence up to 64 steps on each channel simultaneously
    -   Configure up to 1024 pitch changes per channel using arpeggiator
    -   One 8v gate per output per channel
    -   Two Â±10v CV outputs per channel 
        -   1 dedicated pitch output, 1 dedicated modulation output

-   **Built in Quantizer** 
    -   Every pitch signal out of FLXS1 is quantized
    -   Microtonal capabilities built in (more scales coming soon!)

-   **Built in Pitch and Gate Arpeggiator**
    -   Root note, octave, interval, length + direction configurable per step
    -   Ratchet capabilities when interval is set to unison

-   **Complex Modulation CV Output**
    -   Trigger, voltage, LFO or envelope modes
    -   Waveform, frequency, amplitude and offset configurable per step
    -   Tempo Synced LFOs
    -   Modulate Outputs with CV input or internal modulation
    
-   **Extensive Sequence Modulation Capabilities** 
    -   4 Gate inputs and 4 CV inputs
    -   Modulate multiple parameters simultaneously 
        -   Each destination subscribes to a source
    -   Pitch, gate and modulation outputs can be internally routed 
        -   Channels can modulate other with no cables
        
-   **Sync to Your Favorite Gear** 
    -   External gate sync + reset input
    -   MIDI sync to computer via USB - great for multitrack recording!
    -   MIDI sync to other gear with 3.5mm jacks 
        -   (Make Noise + Korg style Adapter sold separately)
        
-   **Internal Memory for up to 16 sequences** 
    -   Banks of saved sequences coming soon!
